## `MCMRSimulator.SequenceParts.get_readouts` â€” Function

```julia
get_readouts(sequence, start_time; readouts=nothing, nTR=1, skip_TR=0)
```

Returns an iterator of the readouts (`IndexedReadout` objects) that will be used for the given sequence in the simulator.

This can be used to identify which readouts will be (or have been) used in the simulation by running: 
```julia
collect(get_readouts(sequence, snapshot.current_time; kwargs...))
```
where `snapshot` is the starting snapshot (which has a `current_time` of 0 by default) and `kwargs` are the keyword arguments used in `readout` (i.e., `readouts`, `nTR`, and `skip_TR`).

By default the readout/ADC objects with the actual sequence definition are used. These can be overridden by `readouts`, which can be set to a vector of the timings of the readouts within each TR.

### Non-repeating sequences

This is the behavior if both `nTR` and `skip_TR` are not set by the user. Any readouts before the `start_time` are ignored. Any readouts after the `start_time` (whether from the `readouts` keyword or within the sequence definition) are returned.

### Repeating sequences

This is the behavior if either `nTR` or `skip_TR` or both are not set by the user. If at `start_time` any of the readouts in the current TR have already passed, then the readout will only start in the next TR (unless `skip_TR` is set to -1). We will skip an additional number of TRs given by `skip_TR` (default: 0). Then readouts will continue for the number of TRs given by `nTR` (default: 1).

## `MCMRSimulator.Geometries.Internal.FixedObstructionGroups.FixedObstructionGroup` - Type

A fixed version of [`ObstructionGroup`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Geometries.User.Obstructions.ObstructionGroups.ObstructionGroup) that is used internally within the simulator.

This is the main internal representation of a group of identical `FixedObstruction` objects.

### Properties

- `obstructions`: vector of the actual `FixedObstruction` objects.
- `parent_index`: Index of this group within the larger [`FixedGeometry`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Geometries.Internal.FixedObstructionGroups.FixedGeometry).
- `original_index`: Index of this group within the original user-provided geometry.
- `rotation`: rotation from global 3-dimensional space to the 1, 2, or 3-dimensional space of the obstructions.
- `inv_rotation`: inverse of the rotation above
- `grid`: `Grid` object on which the obstruction intersections have been precomputed. This speeds up the detection of intersections.
- `bounding_boxes`: vector of [`BoundingBox`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Geometries.Internal.BoundingBoxes.BoundingBox) objects for each obstruction. These are used to predect whether a spin could intersect with the obstruction.
- `volume`: R1, R2, and off-resonance properties of the spins inside the obstructions.
- `surface`: R1, R2, off-resonance, surface_density and dwell_time properties of particles stuck to the surface. Also, contains the permeability and surface relaxation to process collsions.
- `vertices`: vector of vertices (only used for a mesh).

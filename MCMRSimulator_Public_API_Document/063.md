MCMRSimulator.jl allows simulation of MR signal generation using Monte Carlo simulations. The spin evolution of randomly diffusing particles is tracked under the influence of one or more MR sequences.  

## Current Features

- **Free diffusion and diffusion restricted by**  
  - Walls  
  - Cylinders  
  - Spheres  
  - Triangular Mesh  

- **R1 and R2 relaxation**  
  - Using global or local R1/R2 parameters  

- **MR sequences**  
  - Arbitrary RF pulses, gradients, and readouts (built using MRIBuilder or read from pulseq files)  

- **Off-resonance magnetic field generation**  
  - By myelinated cylinders or meshes  

- **Magnetisation transfer**  
  - Between liquid spins and bound spins in membranes  

- **Membrane permeability** (i.e., exchange)  

- **Surface relaxation**  

- **Surface tension of membranes**  
  - Causes spins to get temporarily “stuck” when they hit a membrane  

## Future (Potential) Features

- Macromolecular pool not bound to the membrane  
- Off-resonance field by iron particles  
- Contribution from metabolites (i.e., spectroscopy)  

## Units (Unless Otherwise Noted)

- **Times**: milliseconds (ms)  
  - Equivalently, RF pulse amplitudes and off-resonance magnetic fields are in kilohertz (kHz) (i.e., 1/ms)  

- **Positions**: micrometers (µm)  
  - Thus, gradients are in kHz/µm (not mT/m)  

- **Angles**: degrees (°)  
  - Used for phases (of spins and RF pulses) as well as RF pulse flip angles  

- **Magnetic susceptibilities**: parts per million (ppm)

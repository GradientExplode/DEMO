## MCMRSimulator.TimeSteps.TimeStep

**Type**

```julia
Simulation(timestep=(tortuosity=3e-2, gradient=1e-4, permeability=0.5, surface_relaxation=0.01, transfer_rate=0.01, dwell_time=0.1))
```

Creates an object controlling the timestep of the MCMR simulation.

It can be set by supplying a named tuple to the `timestep` keyword when creating a `Simulation`.

At any time the timestep is guaranteed to be shorter than:

1. `tortuosity` * `size_scale(geometry)`^2 / D, where `size_scale` is the average size of the obstructions and `D` is the `diffusivity`.
2. timestep greater than `permeability` times 1 / (maximum permeability parameter)^2
3. timestep that would allow surface relaxation rate at single collision to be greater than `surface_relaxation`.
4. timestep that would allow magnetisation transfer rate at single collision to be greater than `transfer_rate`.
5. the minimum dwell time of the bound pool times `dwell_time`.
6. (`gradient` /( D * γ^2 * G^2))^(1//3), where γ is the [`gyromagnetic_ratio`](#MCMRSimulator.Constants.gyromagnetic_ratio) and `G` is the current `gradient_strength`.

## `MCMRSimulator.Plot.plot_geometry` — Function

```julia
plot([plot_plane,] geometry; kwargs...)
plot!([scene,] [plot_plane,] geometry; kwargs...)
plot_geometry([plot_plane,] geometry; kwargs...)
plot_geometry!([scene,] [plot_plane,] geometry; kwargs...)
```

Plots a given geometry. If a [`PlotPlane`](#MCMRSimulator.Plot.PlotPlane) is provided the 2D projection of the geometry onto this plane is plotted. Otherwise, the geometry is plotted in 3D.

If you want to overlay the off-resonance field, call [`plot_off_resonance`](#MCMRSimulator.Plot.plot_off_resonance) first before calling this function.

This function will only work if a [`Makie`](https://makie.org/) backend is imported.

### Plot type

The plot type alias for the `plot_geometry` function is `Plot_Geometry`.

### Attributes

- **`alpha`** = `1.0` — Set the transparancy in a 3D plot (0 being fully transparent and 1 fully opague).
- **`backlight`** = `0.0` — Sets a weight for secondary light calculation with inverted normals.
- **`clip_planes`** = `automatic` — Clip planes offer a way to do clipping in 3D space. You can set a Vector of up to 8 `Plane3f` planes here, behind which plots will be clipped (i.e. become invisible). By default clip planes are inherited from the parent plot or scene. You can remove parent `clip_planes` by passing `Plane3f[]`.
- **`color`** = `automatic` — Set the color of the lines (2D) or patches (3D). In 2D it is set to the theme's `linecolor` by default. In 3D each individual obstruction is by default plotted in a different, distinguishable color.
- **`depth_shift`** = `0.0` — adjusts the depth value of a plot after all other transformations, i.e. in clip space, where `0 <= depth <= 1`. This only applies to GLMakie and WGLMakie and can be used to adjust render order (like a tunable overdraw).
- **`diffuse`** = `1.0` — Sets how strongly the red, green and blue channel react to diffuse (scattered) light.
- **`fxaa`** = `true` — adjusts whether the plot is rendered with fxaa (anti-aliasing, GLMakie only).
- **`height`** = `1.0` — Size to plot in μm of infinite walls and cylinders in 3D plot.
- **`inspectable`** = `true` — sets whether this plot should be seen by `DataInspector`.
- **`inspector_clear`** = `automatic` — Sets a callback function `(inspector, plot) -> ...` for cleaning up custom indicators in DataInspector.
- **`inspector_hover`** = `automatic` — Sets a callback function `(inspector, plot, index) -> ...` which replaces the default `show_data` methods.
- **`inspector_label`** = `automatic` — Sets a callback function `(plot, index, position) -> string` which replaces the default label generated by DataInspector.
- **`linestyle`** = `nothing` — Set the linestyle in 2D plots.
- **`linewidth`** = `@inherit linewidth` — Set the linewidth in 2D plots.
- **`material`** = `nothing` — RPRMakie only attribute to set complex RadeonProRender materials. *Warning*, how to set an RPR material may change and other backends will ignore this attribute.
- **`model`** = `automatic` — Sets a model matrix for the plot. This overrides adjustments made with `translate!`, `rotate!` and `scale!`.
- **`nsamples`** = `automatic` — Number of samples in mesh used to plot cylinders (default: 100) and spheres (default: 1000) in 3D plot.
- **`overdraw`** = `false` — Controls if the plot will draw over other plots. This specifically means ignoring depth checks in GL backends.
- **`shading`** = `automatic` — Sets the lighting algorithm used. Options are `NoShading` (no lighting), `FastShading` (AmbientLight + PointLight) or `MultiLightShading` (Multiple lights, GLMakie only). Note that this does not affect RPRMakie.
- **`shininess`** = `32.0` — Sets how sharp the reflection is.
- **`space`** = `:data` — sets the transformation space for box encompassing the plot. See `Makie.spaces()` for possible inputs.
- **`specular`** = `0.2` — Sets how strongly the object reflects light in the red, green and blue channels.
- **`ssao`** = `false` — Adjusts whether the plot is rendered with ssao (screen space ambient occlusion). Note that this only makes sense in 3D plots and is only applicable with `fxaa = true`.
- **`transformation`** = `automatic` — *No docs available.*
- **`transparency`** = `false` — Adjusts how the plot deals with transparency. In GLMakie `transparency = true` results in using Order Independent Transparency.
- **`visible`** = `true` — Controls whether the plot will be rendered or not.

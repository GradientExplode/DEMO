## `MCMRSimulator.Geometries.User.RandomDistribution.random_positions_radii` â€” Function

```julia
random_positions_radii(box_size, target_density, n_dimensions; distribution=Gamma, mean=1., variance=1., max_iter=1000, min_radius=0.1, max_radius=Inf)
```

Randomly distributes circles or spheres in space.

### Arguments

- `box_size`: Size of the infinitely repeating box of random positions
- `target_density`: Final density of the circles/spheres. This density will only be approximately reached
- `n_dimensions`: dimensionality of the space (2 for cicles; 3 for spheres)
- `distribution`: distribution from which the radii are drawn (from [Distributions.jl](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/))
- `mean`: mean of the gamma distribution (ignored if `distribution` explicitly set)
- `variance`: variance of the gamma distribution (ignored if `distribution` explicitly set)
- `max_iter`: maximum number of iterations to try to prevent the circles/spheres from overlapping. An error is raised if they still overlap after this number of iterations.
- `repulsion_strength`: strength of the repulsion in each step (defaults to 0.001).
- `max_iter_repulse`: maximum number of iterations that circles/spheres will be repulsed from each other
- `min_radius`: samples from the distribution below this radius will be rejected (in um).
- `max_radius`: samples from the distribution above this radius will be rejected (in um).

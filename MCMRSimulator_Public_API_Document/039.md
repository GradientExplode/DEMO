## `MCMRSimulator.Plot.plot_off_resonance` — Function

```julia
plot_off_resonance(plot_plane, geometry; kwargs...)
plot_off_resonance!([scene,] plot_plane, geometry; kwargs...)
```

Plots the off-resonance field generated by a given geometry within the [`PlotPlane`](#MCMRSimulator.Plot.PlotPlane).

This function will only work if a [`Makie`](https://makie.org/) backend is imported.

### Plot type

The plot type alias for the `plot_off_resonance` function is `Plot_Off_Resonance`.

### Attributes

- **`alpha`** = `1.0` — The alpha value of the colormap or color attribute. Multiple alphas like in `plot(alpha=0.2, color=(:red, 0.5)`, will get multiplied.
- **`clip_planes`** = `automatic` — Clip planes offer a way to do clipping in 3D space. You can set a Vector of up to 8 `Plane3f` planes here, behind which plots will be clipped (i.e. become invisible). By default clip planes are inherited from the parent plot or scene. You can remove parent `clip_planes` by passing `Plane3f[]`.
- **`colormap`** = `@inherit colormap :viridis` — Sets the colormap that is sampled for numeric `color`s. `PlotUtils.cgrad(...)`, `Makie.Reverse(any_colormap)` can be used as well, or any symbol from ColorBrewer or PlotUtils. To see all available color gradients, you can call `Makie.available_gradients()`.
- **`colorrange`** = `automatic` — The values representing the start and end points of `colormap`.
- **`colorscale`** = `identity` — The color transform function. Can be any function, but only works well together with `Colorbar` for `identity`, `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `sqrt`, `logit`, `Makie.pseudolog10` and `Makie.Symlog10`.
- **`depth_shift`** = `0.0` — adjusts the depth value of a plot after all other transformations, i.e. in clip space, where `0 <= depth <= 1`. This only applies to GLMakie and WGLMakie and can be used to adjust render order (like a tunable overdraw).
- **`fxaa`** = `true` — adjusts whether the plot is rendered with fxaa (anti-aliasing, GLMakie only).
- **`highclip`** = `automatic` — The color for any value above the colorrange.
- **`inspectable`** = `true` — sets whether this plot should be seen by `DataInspector`.
- **`inspector_clear`** = `automatic` — Sets a callback function `(inspector, plot) -> ...` for cleaning up custom indicators in DataInspector.
- **`inspector_hover`** = `automatic` — Sets a callback function `(inspector, plot, index) -> ...` which replaces the default `show_data` methods.
- **`inspector_label`** = `automatic` — Sets a callback function `(plot, index, position) -> string` which replaces the default label generated by DataInspector.
- **`lowclip`** = `automatic` — The color for any value below the colorrange.
- **`model`** = `automatic` — Sets a model matrix for the plot. This overrides adjustments made with `translate!`, `rotate!` and `scale!`.
- **`nan_color`** = `:transparent` — The color for NaN values.
- **`ngrid`** = `400` — sets the number of points where the off-resonance field is evaluated before producing the image. Setting this to a higher number will produce a more accurate image of the off-resonance field at the cost of more computing power.
- **`overdraw`** = `false` — Controls if the plot will draw over other plots. This specifically means ignoring depth checks in GL backends.
- **`space`** = `:data` — sets the transformation space for box encompassing the plot. See `Makie.spaces()` for possible inputs.
- **`ssao`** = `false` — Adjusts whether the plot is rendered with ssao (screen space ambient occlusion). Note that this only makes sense in 3D plots and is only applicable with `fxaa = true`.
- **`transformation`** = `automatic` — *No docs available.*
- **`transparency`** = `false` — Adjusts how the plot deals with transparency. In GLMakie `transparency = true` results in using Order Independent Transparency.
- **`visible`** = `true` — Controls whether the plot will be rendered or not.

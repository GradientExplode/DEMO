## `MCMRSimulator.Geometries.Internal.Susceptibility.Grid.susceptibility_off_resonance` â€” Function

```julia
susceptibility_off_resonance(susceptibility_grid, position[, inside])
```

Computes the susceptibility off-resonance caused by a `SusceptibilityGrid` at given position.

The field is computed in ppm. Knowledge of the scanner `B0` is needed to convert it into KHz.

```julia
susceptibility_off_resonance(simulation, spin)
```

Computes the susceptibility off-resonance caused by all susceptibility sources in the [`Simulation`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Simulations.Simulation) affecting the [`Spin`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Spin).

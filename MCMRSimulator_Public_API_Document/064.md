## Installing the simulator for a specific project

1. **First install Julia** from the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a directory** for the project for which you are going to use the simulator.  
   We will install `MCMRSimulator` in isolation just for this project.  
   This ensures that if we install a newer version of the simulator for another project in the future, it will not interfere with the reproducibility of the results of this project.  
   We will refer to this newly created project directory below as `<project_dir>`.

3. **Start the Julia REPL** in a terminal:
   ```bash
   $ julia --project=<project_dir>
   ```
   The `--project` flag ensures that we create and activate a Julia environment just for this project.  
   This will create a `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` inside the directory specifying the installed packages (such as the MCMR simulator).

4. **Enter the package manager** by pressing `]`.

5. **Install the required packages**:
   ```julia
   pkg> add https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mribuilder.jl.git
   pkg> add https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl.git#v1.0.0
   ```

6. **(Optional)** Install a Makie backend for plotting:
   ```julia
   pkg> add CairoMakie
   ```

7. **(Optional)** To use a Jupyter notebook for this project, install an `IJulia` kernel.  
   You can find instructions for this on the [IJulia documentation](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).

8. **Press `backspace`** to leave the package manager.

9. **(Optional)** To install the MCMRSimulator command-line interface (CLI), run the following in the main Julia REPL:
   ```julia
   using MCMRSimulator
   MCMRSimulator.install_cli(destdir="...")
   ```
   Replace `destdir` with the target directory for the executable (`mcmr` by default).  
   Make sure that this directory is included in your `PATH` environment variable.

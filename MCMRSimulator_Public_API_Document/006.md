## `MCMRSimulator.Spins.Spin` â€” Type

Spin particle with a position and `nsequences` spin orientations (stored as [`SpinOrientation`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.SpinOrientation)).

A random number generator is stored in the `Spin` object as well, which will be used for evolving the spin into the future in a reproducible manner.

### Constructors

```julia
Spin(;nsequences=1, position=[0, 0, 0], longitudinal=1., transverse=0., phase=0.)
```

Creates a new spin with `nsequences` identical spin orientations (given by `longitudinal`, `transverse`, and `phase` flags). The spin will start at given position.

```julia
Spin(reference_spin::Spin{1}, nsequences)
```

Create a new spin with the same position as `reference_spin` with the orientation of `reference_spin` replicated `nsequences` times.

### Extracting spin information

- [`longitudinal`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.longitudinal) to get the `nsequences` spin magnitudes in the z-direction (equilibrium of 1)
- [`transverse`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.transverse) to get the `nsequences` spin magnitudes in the x-y-plane
- [`phase`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.phase) to get the `nsequences` spin angles in x-y plane (in degrees)
- [`orientation`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.orientation) to get a (`nsequences`x3) matrix with the spin orientations in 3D space
- [`position`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.position) to get a length-3 vector with spin location

## `MCMRSimulator.Properties.off_resonance` â€” Function

```julia
off_resonance(snapshot, geometry, global_properties)
off_resonance(spin(s), geometry, global_properties)
off_resonance(position(s), geometry, global_properties)
```

Computes the off-resonance field experienced by each spin in the [`Snapshot`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot).

A tuple is returned with:
1. the off-resonance field due to susceptibility sources in ppm (e.g., myelin/iron).
2. the off-resonance field due to other sources in kHz (i.e., `off_resonance=...` set by the user).

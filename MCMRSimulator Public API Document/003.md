## MCMRSimulator.Subsets.Subset â€” Type

```julia
Subset(; bound=nothing, inside=nothing, geometry_index=nothing, obstruction_index=nothing)
```

This creates a helper object to extract a subset of a [`Snapshot`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot) from the total snapshot. It defines which spins should be kept. This definition is determined by:

- `bound`: set to `true` to return only bound spins, to `false` to return only free spins (default: whether spins are bound is not relevant).
- `inside`: set to `true` to return only spins inside the geometry, to `false` to return only spins outside of the geometry (default: whether spins are inside or outside is not relevant). It can also be set to a positive integer number. Only spins that are inside that exact number of obstructions will be returned.
- `geometry_index`: set to an index to only consider that obstruction group within the total geometry (default: consider the full geometry).
- `obstruction_index`: set to an index to only consider that obstruction group within the total geometry (default: consider the full geometry).

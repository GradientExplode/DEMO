## `MCMRSimulator.Plot.simulator_movie` â€” Function

```julia
simulator_movie(filename, simulation, times, size; resolution=(1600, 800), trajectory_init=30, signal_init=10000, framerate=50, plane_orientation=:z, kwargs...)
```

Writes a movie of the [`Simulation`](#MCMRSimulator.Simulations.Simulation) to the given `filename`.

Each frame of the movie shows the [`Snapshot`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot) at given `times`. `size` is a tuple with the size of the plotted region in the x- and y-direction. If there is a repeating geometry, then it is strongly recommended to use the size of the repeat for `size`.

### Keyword arguments:
- `resolution`: pixel resolution of each frame in the movie.
- `trajectory_init`: how many spins to plot on each frame.
- `signal_init`: how many spins to use to evaluate the signal evolution.
- `framerate`: wait time between each subsequent frame in the movie.
- `plane_orientation`: orientation of the plane on which the spins are projected (see [`PlotPlane`](#MCMRSimulator.Plot.PlotPlane)).

Additional keyword arguments are passed on to [`plot_snapshot`](#MCMRSimulator.Plot.plot_snapshot).

This function will only work if [`Makie`](https://makie.org/) is installed and imported.

```

Creates a set of [`MCMRSimulator.Ring`](https://#MCMRSimulator.Geometries.User.Obstructions.Ring) objects. Fields can be set using keyword arguments. The following fields are available:

- **control_point**: Control points defining the path of the cylinder. Field is required. Expected type: `StaticArraysCore.MVector{3, Float64}`.
- **radius**: Radius at each control point. Field is required. Expected type: `Float64`.
- **spline_order**: Sets the order of the b-spine interpolating between control points. Field is required. Expected type: `Int64`. Default value: `3`
- **myelin**: Whether the cylinder is myelinated. Field is required. Expected type: `Bool`. Default value: `false`
- **rotation**: Rotation applied to all obstructions in group. Can be set to a matrix or one of `:x`, `:y`, or `:z` (see [`MCMRSimulator.get_rotation`](https://#MCMRSimulator.Methods.get_rotation)). Field is required. Expected type: `StaticArraysCore.SMatrix{3, 3, Float64, 9}`. Default value: `[1.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 1.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 1.0]`
- **R1_surface**: Additional longitudinal relaxation rate (kHz). Surface property. Field is required. Expected type: `Float64`. Default value: `0.0`
- **R1_inside**: Additional longitudinal relaxation rate (kHz). Inside property. Field is required. Expected type: `Float64`. Default value: `0.0`
- **R2_surface**: Additional transverse relaxation rate (kHz). Surface property. Field is required. Expected type: `Float64`. Default value: `0.0`
- **R2_inside**: Additional transverse relaxation rate (kHz). Inside property. Field is required. Expected type: `Float64`. Default value: `0.0`
- **off_resonance_surface**: Additional off-resonance field offset (kHz). Surface property. Field is required. Expected type: `Float64`. Default value: `0.0`
- **off_resonance_inside**: Additional off-resonance field offset (kHz). Inside property. Field is required. Expected type: `Float64`. Default value: `0.0`
- **nsamples**: Number of mesh vertices along each ring. Field can be null. Expected type: `Int64`. Default value: `100`
- **closed**: After how many repeats in each dimension does the cylinder connect with itself. If not set the cylinder is not closed. Field can be null. Expected type: `StaticArraysCore.MVector{3, Int64}`.
- **susceptibility_iso**: Isotropic component of the susceptibility (in ppm um). It can be calculated by multiplying the isotropic susceptibility of the simulated tissue by the thickness. Field can be null. Expected type: `Float64`. Default value: `-0.1`
- **susceptibility_aniso**: Anisotropic component of the susceptibility (in ppm um). It can be calculated by multiplying the anisotropic susceptibility of the simulated tissue by the thickness. Field can be null. Expected type: `Float64`. Default value: `-0.1`
- **lorentz_radius**: Only compute field explicitly for triangles with this Lorentz radius. Field can be null. Expected type: `Float64`. Default value: `5.0`
- **repeats**: Length scale on which the obstructions are repeated (um). Field can be null. Expected type: `StaticArraysCore.MVector{3, Float64}`.
- **use_boundingbox**: Use bounding boxes for an initial filtering of possible intersections. Field can be null. Expected type: `Bool`. Default value: `true`
- **grid_resolution**: Resolution of the grid that the volume is split up into (um). Defaults to roughly one grid element per obstruction. Field can be null. Expected type: `Float64`.
- **dwell_time**: Average time a particle stays stuck to the surface (ms). Surface property. Field can be null. Expected type: `Float64`.
- **density**: Surface density of stuck particles relative to the volume density (um). Surface property. Field can be null. Expected type: `Float64`.
- **permeability**: Rate of particle passing through the obstruction in arbitrary units. Surface property. Field can be null. Expected type: `Float64`.
- **relaxation**: Rate of signal loss at each collision. The actual signal loss at each collision is `e^(-x * sqrt(t))`, where `x` is this rate and `t` is the timestep. Surface property. Field can be null. Expected type: `Float64`.
- **size_scale**: Size of the smallest obstructions. If not set explicitly, this will be determined by the minimum radius or distance between objects (see `size_scale`). Field can be null. Expected type: `Float64`.

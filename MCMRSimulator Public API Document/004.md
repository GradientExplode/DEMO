## `MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot` â€” Type

Represents the positions and orientations of multiple [`Spin`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Spin) objects at a specific `time`.

Note that times are in milliseconds and positions in micrometer. The equilibrium longitudinal spin (after T1 relaxation) is always 1.

### Useful constructors

```julia
Snapshot(positions; time=0., longitudinal=1., transverse=0., phase=0., nsequences=1)
Snapshot(nspins[, bounding_box[, geometry]]; time=0., longitudinal=1., transverse=0., phase=0., nsequences=1)
Snapshot(nspins, simulation[, bounding_box; time=0., longitudinal=1., transverse=0., phase=0., nsequences=1)
```

Creates a new Snapshot at the given `time` with spins initialised for simulating `nsequences` sequences. All spins will start out in equilibrium, but that can be changed using the `longitudinal`, `transverse`, and/or `phase` flags. This initial spin locations are given by `positions` (Nx3 matrix or sequence of vectors of size 3). Alternatively the number of spins can be given in which case the spins are randomly distributed in the given `bounding_box` (default: 1x1x1 mm box centered on origin). The bounding_box can be a [`BoundingBox`](#MCMRSimulator.Geometries.Internal.BoundingBoxes.BoundingBox) object, a tuple with the lower and upper bounds (i.e., two vectors of length 3) or a number `r` (resulting in spins filling a cube from `-r` to `+r`).

```julia
Snapshot(snap::Snapshot{1}, nsequences)
```

Replicates the positions and orientations for a single sequence in the input snapshot across `nsequences`.

### Extracting summary information

- [`longitudinal`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.longitudinal)(snapshot) to get the `nsequences` spin magnitudes in the z-direction (equilibrium of 1) averaged over all spins
- [`transverse`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.transverse)(snapshot) to get the `nsequences` spin magnitudes in the x-y-plane averaged over all spins
- [`phase`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.phase)(snapshot) to get the `nsequences` spin angles in x-y plane (in degrees) averaged over all spins
- [`orientation`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.orientation)(snapshot) to get a (`nsequences`x3) matrix with the spin orientations in 3D space averaged over all spins
- [`SpinOrientation`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.SpinOrientation)(snapshot) to get a `nsequences` vector of [`SpinOrientation`] objects with the average spin orientation across all spins
- [`position`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.position).(snapshot) to get a the position for each spin in a vector (no averaging applied)

Information for a single sequence can be extracted by calling [`get_sequence`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.get_sequence) first.

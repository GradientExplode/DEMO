MCMRSimulator.Geometries.User.Obstructions.ObstructionGroups.ObstructionGroup{:Spheres})(; fields...)
```

Creates a set of [`MCMRSimulator.Sphere`](#MCMRSimulator.Geometries.User.Obstructions.Sphere) objects. Fields can be set using keyword arguments. The following fields are available:

- `radius`: Radius of the cylinder. Field is required. Expected type: Float64.
- `rotation`: Rotation applied to all obstructions in group. Can be set to a matrix or one of `:x`, `:y`, or `:z` (see [`MCMRSimulator.get_rotation`](#MCMRSimulator.Methods.get_rotation)). Field is required. Expected type: `StaticArraysCore.SMatrix{3, 3, Float64, 9}`. Default value: `[1.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 1.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 1.0]`
- `R1_surface`: Additional longitudinal relaxation rate (kHz). Surface property. Field is required. Expected type: Float64. Default value: `0.0`
- `R1_inside`: Additional longitudinal relaxation rate (kHz). Inside property. Field is required. Expected type: Float64. Default value: `0.0`
- `R2_surface`: Additional transverse relaxation rate (kHz). Surface property. Field is required. Expected type: Float64. Default value: `0.0`
- `R2_inside`: Additional transverse relaxation rate (kHz). Inside property. Field is required. Expected type: Float64. Default value: `0.0`
- `off_resonance_surface`: Additional off-resonance field offset (kHz). Surface property. Field is required. Expected type: Float64. Default value: `0.0`
- `off_resonance_inside`: Additional off-resonance field offset (kHz). Inside property. Field is required. Expected type: Float64. Default value: `0.0`
- `position`: Spatial offset of obstruction from origin. Field is required. Expected type: `StaticArraysCore.MVector{3, Float64}`. Default value: `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`
- `repeats`: Length scale on which the obstructions are repeated (um). Field can be null. Expected type: `StaticArraysCore.MVector{3, Float64}`.
- `use_boundingbox`: Use bounding boxes for an initial filtering of possible intersections. Field can be null. Expected type: Bool. Default value: `true`
- `grid_resolution`: Resolution of the grid that the volume is split up into (um). Defaults to roughly one grid element per obstruction. Field can be null. Expected type: Float64.
- `dwell_time`: Average time a particle stays stuck to the surface (ms). Surface property. Field can be null. Expected type: Float64.
- `density`: Surface density of stuck particles relative to the volume density (um). Surface property. Field can be null. Expected type: Float64.
- `permeability`: Rate of particle passing through the obstruction in arbitrary units. Surface property. Field can be null. Expected type: Float64.
- `relaxation`: Rate of signal loss at each collision. The actual signal loss at each collision is `e^(-x * sqrt(t))`, where `x` is this rate and `t` is the timestep. Surface property. Field can be null. Expected type: Float64.
- `size_scale`: Size of the smallest obstructions. If not set explicitly, this will be determined by the minimum radius or distance between objects (see `size_scale`). Field can be null. Expected type: Float64.

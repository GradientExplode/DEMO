## `MCMRSimulator.Evolve.readout` â€” Function

```julia
readout(spins, simulation[, readout_times]; bounding_box=<1x1x1 mm box>, skip_TR=0, nTR=1, return_snapshot=false, subset=<all>)
```

Evolves a set of spins through the [`Simulation`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Simulations.Simulation). Returns the total signal or a full [`Snapshot`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot) at every readout time in the simulated sequences over one or more repetition times (TRs).

### Positional arguments:

- `spins`: Number of spins to simulate or an already existing [`Snapshot`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot).
- `simulation`: [`Simulation`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Simulations.Simulation) object defining the environment, scanner, and sequence(s).
- `times` (optional): time of the readouts relative to the start of the TR (in ms). If not provided, the times of any `MRIBuilder.ADC` objects in the sequence will be used (see [`get_readouts`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.SequenceParts.get_readouts) for details).

### Keyword arguments:

- `bounding_box`: size of the voxel in which the spins are initiated in um (default is 1000, corresponding to a 1x1x1 mm box centered on zero). Can be set to a [`BoundingBox`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Geometries.Internal.BoundingBoxes.BoundingBox) object for more control.
- `skip_TR`: Number of repetition times to skip before starting the readout. Even if set to zero (the default), the simulator will still skip the current TR before starting the readout if the starting snapshot is from a time past one of the sequence readouts. See [`get_readouts`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.SequenceParts.get_readouts) for details.
- `nTR`: number of TRs for which to store the output. See [`get_readouts`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.SequenceParts.get_readouts) for details.
- `return_snapshot`: set to true to output the state of all the spins as a [`Snapshot`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot) at each readout instead of a [`SpinOrientationSum`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.SpinOrientationSum) with the total signal.
- `subset`: Return the signal/snapshot for a subset of all spins. Can be set to a single or a vector of [`Subset`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Subsets.Subset) objects. If set to a vector, this will add an additional dimension to the output.

### Returns

The function returns an up to 3-dimensional (KxLxMxN) array, with the following dimensions:

- `K`: the number of sequences. This dimension is not included if the simulation only contains a single sequence (and this single sequence is not passed into the [`Simulation`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Simulations.Simulation) as a vector).
- `L`: the number of readout times with a single TR. This dimension is skipped if the `readout_times` is set to a scalar number. This dimension might contain `nothing`s for sequences that contain fewer `Readout.ADC` objects than the maximum (`M`).
- `M`: the number of TRs (controlled by the `nTR` keyword). If `nTR` is not explicitly set by the user, this dimension is skipped.
- `N`: the number of subsets (controlled by the `subset` keyword). If `subset` is set to a single value (<all> by default), this dimension is skipped.

By default each element of this matrix is either a [`SpinOrientationSum`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.SpinOrientationSum) with the total signal. If `return_snapshot=true` is set, each element is the full [`Snapshot`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot) instead.

## MCMRSimulator.Plot.plot_trajectory

**Function**: [`MCMRSimulator.Plot.plot_trajectory`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Plot.plot_trajectory)

### Usage
```julia
plot([plot_plane], snapshots; kwargs...)
plot!([scene,] [plot_plane], snapshots; kwargs...)
plot_trajectory([plot_plane], snapshots; kwargs...)
plot_trajectory!([scene,] [plot_plane], snapshots; kwargs...)
```

### Description
Plots the spin trajectory in a vector of [`Snapshot`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot) on an existing plot scene.

The spins are plotted in 2D projected onto the [`PlotPlane`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Plot.PlotPlane) if one is provided. Otherwise, the spins are plotted in 3D. At each location along the trajectory, the colour is set by the transverse magnetisation. Additional keywords are passed on to `Makie.lines!`.

This function will only work if [`Makie`](https://makie.org/) is installed and imported.

### Plot Type
The plot type alias for the `plot_trajectory` function is `Plot_Trajectory`.

### Attributes

#### `clip_planes` = `automatic`
Clip planes offer a way to do clipping in 3D space. You can set a Vector of up to 8 `Plane3f` planes here, behind which plots will be clipped (i.e. become invisible). By default clip planes are inherited from the parent plot or scene. You can remove parent `clip_planes` by passing `Plane3f[]`.

#### `color` = `automatic`
*No docs available.*

#### `depth_shift` = `0.0`
Adjusts the depth value of a plot after all other transformations, i.e. in clip space, where `0 <= depth <= 1`. This only applies to GLMakie and WGLMakie and can be used to adjust render order (like a tunable overdraw).

#### `fxaa` = `true`
Adjusts whether the plot is rendered with fxaa (anti-aliasing, GLMakie only).

#### `inspectable` = `true`
Sets whether this plot should be seen by `DataInspector`.

#### `inspector_clear` = `automatic`
Sets a callback function `(inspector, plot) -> ...` for cleaning up custom indicators in DataInspector.

#### `inspector_hover` = `automatic`
Sets a callback function `(inspector, plot, index) -> ...` which replaces the default `show_data` methods.

#### `inspector_label` = `automatic`
Sets a callback function `(plot, index, position) -> string` which replaces the default label generated by DataInspector.

#### `model` = `automatic`
Sets a model matrix for the plot. This overrides adjustments made with `translate!`, `rotate!` and `scale!`.

#### `overdraw` = `false`
Controls if the plot will draw over other plots. This specifically means ignoring depth checks in GL backends.

#### `sequence` = `1`
Which magnetisation to plot if multiple sequences were simulated.

#### `space` = `:data`
Sets the transformation space for box encompassing the plot. See `Makie.spaces()` for possible inputs.

#### `ssao` = `false`
Adjusts whether the plot is rendered with ssao (screen space ambient occlusion). Note that this only makes sense in 3D plots and is only applicable with `fxaa = true`.

#### `transformation` = `automatic`
*No docs available.*

#### `transparency` = `false`
Adjusts how the plot deals with transparency. In GLMakie `transparency = true` results in using Order Independent Transparency.

#### `visible` = `true`
Controls whether the plot will be rendered or not.

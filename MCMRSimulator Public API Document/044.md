## `MCMRSimulator.SequenceParts.IndexedReadout` â€” Type

```julia
IndexedReadout(time, TR, readout)
```

Represents a readout in an MR sequence.

Generate these for a sequence of interest using [`get_readouts`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.SequenceParts.get_readouts).

All indices are integers. They refer to:

- `time`: time since beginning of sequence in ms  
- `TR`: which TR the simulation is in (defaults to 0 if not set).  
- `readout`: which readout within the TR (or total sequence) this is.

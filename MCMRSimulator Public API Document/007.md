## `MCMRSimulator.Subsets.get_subset` - Function

```julia
get_subset(snapshot, simulation, subset)
get_subset(snapshot, simulation; bound=nothing, inside=nothing, geometry_index=nothing, obstruction_index=nothing)
```

Returns a subset of the [`Snapshot`](#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot) from the [`Simulation`](#MCMRSimulator.Simulations.Simulation) that obey some specific properties. These properties can be either defined by a [`Subset`](#MCMRSimulator.Subsets.Subset) object or a set of keyword arguments.

These keyword arguments are:

- `bound`: set to `true` to return only bound spins, to `false` to return only free spins (default: whether spins are bound is not relevant).
- `inside`: set to `true` to return only spins inside the geometry, to `false` to return only spins outside of the geometry (default: whether spins are inside or outside is not relevant). It can also be set to a positive integer number. Only spins that are inside that exact number of obstructions will be returned.
- `geometry_index`: set to an index to only consider that obstruction group within the total geometry (default: consider the full geometry).
- `obstruction_index`: set to an index to only consider that obstruction group within the total geometry (default: consider the full geometry).

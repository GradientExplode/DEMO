## `MCMRSimulator.Simulations.Simulation` â€” Type

```julia
Simulation(
    sequences; geometry=[], diffusivity=3.,
    R1=0, T1=Inf, R2=0, T2=Inf, off_resonance=0, MT_fraction=0, permeability=0,,
    timestep=<default parameters>,
)
```

Defines the setup of the simulation and stores the output of the run.

### Arguments

#### General parameters:
- `sequences`: Vector of `MRIBuilder.Sequence` objects. During the spin random walk the simulation will keep track of the spin magnetisations for all of the provided sequences.
- `geometry`: Set of obstructions, which can be used to restrict the diffusion, produce off-resonance fields, alter the local T1/T2 relaxation, and as sources of magnetisation transfer.
- `diffusivity`: Rate of the random motion of the spins in um^2/ms (default: 3).
- `verbose`: set to false to silence descriptions of the simulation parameters (default: true).

#### MRI properties
These parameters determine the evolution and relaxation of the spin magnetisation.

- `R1`/`T1`: sets the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1 in kHz) or relaxation time (T1=1/R1 in ms). This determines how fast the longitudinal magnetisation returns to its equilibrium value of 1.
- `R2`/`T2`: sets the transverse relaxation rate (R2 in kHz) or relaxation time (T2=1/R2 in ms). This determines how fast the transverse magnetisation is lost.
- `off_resonance`: Size of the off-resonance field in this voxel in kHz.

These MRI properties can be overriden for spins inside the [`ObstructionGroup`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Geometries.User.Obstructions.ObstructionGroups.ObstructionGroup) objects of the `geometry`.

#### Collision parameters
These parameters determine how parameters behave when hitting the [`ObstructionGroup`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Geometries.User.Obstructions.ObstructionGroups.ObstructionGroup) objects of the `geometry`. They can be overriden for individual objects for each [`ObstructionGroup`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Geometries.User.Obstructions.ObstructionGroups.ObstructionGroup).

- `MT_fraction`: the fraction of magnetisation transfered between the obstruction and the water spin at each collision.
- `permeability`: the rate of spins passing through the surface in arbitrary units (set to infinity for fully permeable surface).
- `surface_density`: Density of spins stuck on the surface relative to the volume density of hte free water.
- `dwell_time`: Typical time that spins will stay at the surface after getting stuck.

Note that `MT_fraction` and `permeability` are internally adjusted to make their effect independent of the timestep.

#### Timestep parameters
`timestep` controls the timepoints at which the simulation is evaluated. By default, the maximum allowable timestep will be determined by the geometry and biophysical parameters as described in [`MCMRSimulator.TimeStep`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.TimeSteps.TimeStep). That documentation also describes how to adjust these settings. The timestep can also be set to a number to ignore any of these parameters. Note that a too large timestep will lead to inaccurate results.

#### Running the simulation
To run a [`Snapshot`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot) of spins through the simulations you can use one of the following functions:

- `evolve`: evolves the spins in the snapshot until a single given time and returns that state in a new [`Snapshot`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot).
- `readout`: evolves the spins to particular times in each TR and return the total signal at that time (or a [`Snapshot`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/dev/api/#MCMRSimulator.Spins.Snapshot)).

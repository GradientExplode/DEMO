# MRIBuilder.Pathways.Pathway

**Type**: `MRIBuilder.Pathways.Pathway`

```julia
Pathway(sequence::Sequence, pulse_effects::Vector{:Symbol/Number}, readout_index=1; group=nothing)
```

Describes how a specific spin/isochromat might experience the sequence.

Only a single pathway through the RF pulses is considered, so that at every point in time the spins are in one of the following four states:

- **+longitudinal**: initial relaxed state
- **+transverse**: excited state. During this time gradients will affect the [`variables.area_under_curve`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mribuilder.jl/stable/defining_sequence/#MRIBuilder.Variables.variables.area_under_curve) (or [`variables.qval`](../sequence_optimisation/#MRIBuilder.Variables.variables.qval-sequence_optimisation)) and [`variables.bval`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mribuilder.jl/stable/defining_sequence/#MRIBuilder.Variables.variables.bval).
- **-longitudinal**: inverse state
- **-transverse**: inverse excited state. During this time all gradients will have the inverse effect compared with +transverse.

The RF pulses cause mappings between these different states as described below.

## Parameters

- `sequence`: MRI [`Sequence`](../api/#MRIBuilder.Containers.BaseSequences.Sequence) to be considered.
- `pulse_effects`: How each RF pulse affects the spins. This can be one of the following:
  - `:skip`/`:ignore`/0: This RF pulse leaves the spins unaffected.
  - `:refocus`/`:invert`/180: Flips the sign of the spin state (i.e., +longitudinal <-> -longitudinal, +transverse <-> -transverse)
  - `:excite`/90: Takes spin state one step along the following sequence +longitudinal -> +transverse -> -longitudinal -> -transverse -> +longitudinal
  - `:neg_excite`/270/-90: Inverse step compared with `:excite`.
- `readout_index`: After encountering the number of pulses as defined in `pulse_effects`, continue the `Pathway` until the readout given by `index` is reached. If set to 0 the `Pathway` is terminated immediately after the last RF pulse.
- `group`: which gradient grouping to consider for the `net_dephasing` and `bmat`. If not set, all gradients will be considered (using their current alignment).

## Attributes

Over the pathway the following values are computed. Each can be accessed by calling the appropriate function:

### Timings

- [`variables.duration_state`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mribuilder.jl/stable/defining_sequence/#MRIBuilder.Variables.variables.duration_state): The total amount of time spent in a specific state in this pathway (+longitudinal, +transverse, -longitudinal, or -transverse)
- [`variables.duration_transverse`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mribuilder.jl/stable/defining_sequence/#MRIBuilder.Variables.variables.duration_transverse): The total amount of time the spins spent in the transverse plane in ms. This can be used to quantify the expected effect of T2-decay.
- [`variables.duration_dephase`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mribuilder.jl/stable/defining_sequence/#MRIBuilder.Variables.variables.duration_dephase): The total amount of time the spins spent in the +transverse relative to -transverse state in ms. The absolute value of this can be used to quantify the expected effect of T2'-decay.

### Effect of gradients

The area under curve, q-values, and b-values are computed separately for each group of gradients (depending on the `group` keyword set during construction).

- [`variables.net_dephasing`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mribuilder.jl/stable/defining_sequence/#MRIBuilder.Variables.variables.net_dephasing): Net displacement vector in k-space/q-space.
- [`variables.bmat`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mribuilder.jl/stable/defining_sequence/#MRIBuilder.Variables.variables.bmat): Net diffusion weighting due to gradients along the `Pathway` in matrix form.
- [`variables.bval`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mribuilder.jl/stable/defining_sequence/#MRIBuilder.Variables.variables.bval): Net diffusion weighting due to gradients along the `Pathway` as a single number.

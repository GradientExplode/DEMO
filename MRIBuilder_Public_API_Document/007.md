# MRIBuilder.BuildSequences.build_sequence

Wrapper to build a sequence.

## Usage

Use as:
```julia
build_sequence(scanner;) do
    ...
end
```

Within the code block you can create one or more sequences, e.g.:
```julia
seq = Sequence(
    SincPulse(flip_angle=90, phase=0, duration=2., bandwidth=:max)
    nothing.,
    SingleReadout
)
```

You can also add any arbitrary constraints or objectives using one of:
- `set_simple_constraints!`
- `apply_simple_constraint!`
- `add_cost_function!`

As soon as the code block ends the sequence is optimised (if `optimise=true`) and returned.

## Parameters

- `scanner`: Set to a [`Scanner`](../scanners/#MRIBuilder.Scanners.Scanner) to limit the gradient strength and slew rate. When this call to `build_sequence` is embedded in another, this parameter can be set to `nothing` to indicate that the same scanner should be used.
- `optimise`: Whether to optimise and fix the sequence as soon as it is returned. This defaults to `true` if a scanner is provided and `false` if no scanner is provided.
- `n_attempts`: How many times to restart the optimiser (default: 20)? Decrease if you want to quickly check feasibility of a simple sequence. Increase if convergence fails for a complex sequence.
- `kwargs...`: Other keywords are passed on as attributes to the `optimiser_constructor` (e.g., set `print_level=3` to make the Ipopt optimiser quieter).

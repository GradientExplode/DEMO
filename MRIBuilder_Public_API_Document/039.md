# Scanners

The MRI scanner that is used during acquisition puts various constraints on the MR sequences that can be used. These constraints include safety considerations, such as tissue heating, and hardware constraints, such as maximum gradient strength and slew rate. Currently, MRIBuilder only considers the latter.

To define a sequence appropriate for a specific scanner, a user would define a new `Scanner` with the appropriate `B0`, maximum `variables.gradient_strength`, and maximum `variables.slew_rate`. This scanner would then be passed on to the [sequence optimisation](../sequence_optimisation/#sequence_optimisation).

For ease of use, the `gradient_strength` and `slew_rate` of many scanners have already been pre-defined. These are listed below.

## Scanners API

### Scanner
```julia
Scanner(B0, gradient_strength, slew_rate)
```
Defines an MRI scanner with the given parameters.

**Parameters:**
- `B0`: The static magnetic field strength (in Tesla)
- `gradient_strength`: Maximum gradient strength (in mT/m)
- `slew_rate`: Maximum slew rate (in T/m/s)

### Pre-defined Scanners
The following scanners have pre-defined gradient strengths and slew rates:

| Scanner Model       | B0 (T) | Gradient Strength (mT/m) | Slew Rate (T/m/s) |
|---------------------|--------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Siemens Prisma      | 3.0    | 80                       | 200               |
| GE Discovery MR750  | 3.0    | 50                       | 200               |
| Philips Achieva     | 3.0    | 45                       | 200               |
| Siemens Skyra       | 3.0    | 45                       | 200               |

### Example Usage
```julia
using MRIBuilder

# Define a custom scanner
my_scanner = Scanner(3.0, 60.0, 150.0)

# Or use a pre-defined scanner
prisma = Scanners.SiemensPrisma()
```

```julia
  adjust(sequence, pulse=(scale=0.8, ))
  ```
- Repeat sequence 2 times with different diffusion-weighted gradient orientations (x- and y-direction) and gradient strength reduced by 30%:  
  ```julia
  adjust(sequence, diffusion=(orientation=[[1., 0., 0], [0., 1., 0.]], scale=0.7))
  ```
- Repeat the sequence by shifting the excited slice by the given number of millimetres in the slice-select direction:  
  ```julia
  adjust(sequence, FOV=(shift=[-7.5, -2.5, 2.5, 7.5, -5., 0., 5., 10.]))
  ```
  These shifts represent an interleaved acquisition scheme, where the acquired slices/bands are 2.5 mm apart.
- Rotations defined using the [`Rotations.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Rotations.jl) package can be applied to gradient orientations or the field of view. For example, to rotate the field of view by 45 degrees around the y-axis:
  ```julia
  using Rotations
  rotation = Rotations.AngleAxis(deg2rad(45), 0., 1., 0.)
  adjust(sequence, FOV=(rotation=rotation, ))
  ```

When repeating the same sequence, a spoiler gradient and/or dead time can be added in between each pair of repeats by supplying the appropriate keywords to the `merge` parameter in `adjust` (e.g., `merge=(wait_time=10., )`). These parameters are described in more detail in `merge_sequences`.

## Post-hoc Adjustments API

### `adjust`

```julia
adjust(sequence::AbstractBlock; kwargs...)
```

Adjusts a sequence by applying transformations to labeled RF pulses or gradients. Supported keyword arguments include:

- **`pulse`**: Apply transformations to all RF pulses.
- **`gradient`**: Apply transformations to all gradients.
- **`merge`**: Add spoiler gradients or dead time between repeated sequences.

#### Example Usage

```julia
# Reduce RF pulse amplitude by 20%
adjust(sequence, pulse=(scale=0.8, ))

# Repeat sequence with different diffusion gradients
adjust(sequence, diffusion=(orientation=[[1., 0., 0], [0., 1., 0.]], scale=0.7))

# Add dead time between repeats
adjust(sequence, merge=(wait_time=10., ))
```

### `merge_sequences`

```julia
merge_sequences(sequences::Vararg{Sequence}; kwargs...)
```

Merges multiple sequences with optional spoiler gradients or dead time between them. Supported keyword arguments:

- **`wait_time`**: Adds dead time (in milliseconds) between sequences.
- **`spoiler`**: Adds a spoiler gradient (specify amplitude and duration).

#### Example Usage

```julia
merge_sequences(seq1, seq2, wait_time=5., spoiler=(amplitude=10., duration=2.))
```

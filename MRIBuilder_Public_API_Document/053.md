# MRIBuilder.Variables.adjust

```julia
adjust(block; kwargs...)
```

Generate one or more new sequences/building_blocks/components with some post-fitting adjustments.

## Allowed Adjustments

### For MR Gradients
- `orientation`: Set the orientation to a given vector.
- `rotation`: Rotate the gradient orientations using rotations from [Rotations.jl](https://juliageometry.github.io/Rotations.jl/stable/).
- `scale`: Multiply the gradient strength by the given value.  
  **Note:** Values outside -1 to 1 may break the scanner's maximum gradient or slew rate.

### For RF Pulses
- `frequency`: Shift the off-resonance frequency by the given value (in kHz).
- `scale`: Multiply the RF pulse amplitude by the given value (used to model the B1 transmit field).

## Usage Notes

- Pass a vector of multiple values to create multiple sequences with different adjustments (usually merged together).
- Get individual sequences by passing `merge=false`.
- Adjust time between repeated sequences using keywords from [`merge_sequences`](https://pages.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mribuilder.jl/stable/adjust_sequences/#MRIBuilder.PostHoc.merge_sequences-Tuple{Vararg{Sequence}}):  
  Example: `merge=(wait_time=10,)` adds a 10ms wait between sequences.

## Targeting Specific Components

- Adjust specific sequence components by their `group` name:  
  Example: `adjust(sequence, diffusion=(orientation=[0, 1, 0],))` sets gradients in group `:diffusion` to y-direction.
- Affect all gradients/pulses using:  
  - `gradient=` for all gradients  
  - `pulse` for all RF pulses  
  Example: `adjust(sequence, pulse=(scale=0.5,))` halves all RF pulse amplitudes.

## `MRIBuilder.PostHoc.merge_sequences` â€” Method

```julia
merge_sequences(sequences...; wait_time=0.)
```

Merge multiple sequences together.

Sequences will be run one after each other with `wait_time` in between.

``` 

### Description
This method merges multiple sequences, executing them sequentially with an optional delay (`wait_time`) between each sequence.

### Parameters
- `sequences...`: Variable number of sequences to merge.
- `wait_time` (optional, default `0.`): Time delay (in seconds) inserted between sequences.

### Example
```julia
# Merge two sequences with a 1-second delay
merged_seq = merge_sequences(seq1, seq2, wait_time=1.0)
```

### Notes
- Useful for combining independent sequences into a single execution flow.
- The `wait_time` parameter allows synchronization or timing adjustments between sequences.
